#Find unusual patterns by identifying variations and covariation between the features in the dataset and perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to justify outcomes with supporting questions and visualisations.

#We can see the distribution of the continuous variable HOUR broken down by the categorical value TYPE using covariation.
ggplot(data = crime, mapping = aes(x = HOUR)) +
  geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(color = TYPE), binwidth = 500)

#We are using density instead of count in order to make fair comparison using covariation.
